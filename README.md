# show_badgeos_badges_on_buddypress
Ever been to a forum site where rankings are displayed under post authors? This is exactly what this is for :)

This plugin uses the BuddyPress, bbPress, and BadgeOS APIs. I've purposely made it so that it cannot be configured through the WP admin panel. You'll need to export your BadgeOS ID numbers to know your badge ID numbers.
